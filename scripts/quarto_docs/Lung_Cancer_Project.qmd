## Quarto USF Lung Cancer Workflow

[Single Cell Dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/E-MTAB-6149/14308775)

### In R, we convert the .rds files so they can be used in Python workflow 

```{r Convert RDS files from Figshare to appropriate files for python workflow, eval = F}
library(Matrix)
expr_sparse = readRDS("~/USF_Lung_Cancer/E-MTAB-6149_expr_sparse.rds")
writeMM(m, file = "matrix.mtx")
write.csv(rownames(m), "genes.csv")
write.csv(colnames(m), "barcodes.csv")
```

Next, we run our snakemake and python scripts in order to perform the comparison in TXRN1 expression between cancer and immune cells.

```{bash, Run Snakemake script to run python script}

```
