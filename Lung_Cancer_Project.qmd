## Quarto USF Lung Cancer Workflow
To start the analysis, we can utilize the containerization software Docker in order to ensure reproducibility on different machines as well as repeatability (rerunning same workflow on same data returns same results!). Docker can be downloaded via the web or by utilizing homebrew (Mac) or other OS package managers. *brew install docker-desktop --cask*
