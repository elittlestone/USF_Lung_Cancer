MissingOutputException in rule run_celltype_annotation in file "/Users/ethanlittlestone/USF_Lung_Cancer/scripts/snakemake_scripts/sc_geo_workflow.smk", line 35:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/geo_figures/umap_celltypist.png (missing locally, parent dir contents: umap_leiden_scvi_clusters.png, violin_qc.png, scatter_total_counts_vs_gene_counts.png, scatter_total_counts_vs_per_mito_counts.png, umap_qc_metrics_scvi.png, umap_samples_scvi.png)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
